##InjectJS another NodeJS Framework meant for dependency management and other cool stuff.


#GIT Working model - Please use this.
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/centralized-workflow

#GIT Commit messages
-Ideally we would follow this pattern for git commit messages:
 git commit -m "[INTERNAL] Something that changed, but is not a fix, neither a new functionality"
 git commit -m "[FEATURE] New features added to the code. Please include tests ;)"
 git commit -m "[FIX] Some fix that has been included. The actuall commit message should have the problem description and the fix description. Including the Issue ID if existent"


#Major Todos:
1) Make the framework run (dependencies)
2) Make the demo work
3) Add Continuous integration to the workflow
4) Change test framework to Mocha
5) Fix tests
