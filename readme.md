## GIT Working model
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/centralized-workflow

## GIT Commit messages
 Ideally we would follow this pattern for git commit messages:
- git commit -m "[INTERNAL] Something that changed, but is not a fix, neither a new functionality"
- git commit -m "[FEATURE] New features added to the code. Please include tests ;)"
- git commit -m "[FIX] Some fix that has been included. The actuall commit message should have the problem description and the fix description. Including the Issue ID if existent"
